# 🎯 **UI DIFFERENTIATION ISSUE - FIXED!**

## 🔍 **Root Cause Found:**

The issue was a **CSS class mismatch** between HTML and JavaScript:

### **❌ The Problem:**
- **HTML**: `<div class="controls">`
- **JavaScript**: `document.querySelector('.stream-controls')`
- **Result**: JavaScript couldn't find the element to update!

### **✅ The Fix:**
- **Updated HTML**: `<div class="controls stream-controls">`
- **Now JavaScript can find**: `.stream-controls` ✅

## 🛠️ **What Was Happening:**

1. **WebSocket handshake** was working perfectly ✅
2. **Server responses** were correct ✅  
3. **JavaScript logic** was correct ✅
4. **BUT**: `document.querySelector('.stream-controls')` returned `null`
5. **So**: UI updates were silently failing ❌

## 🎯 **Expected Results Now:**

### **🎬 Streamer (Port 8080):**
```
Header: "Sutantra STREAMER"
Controls: [▶ Start Stream] [⏹ Stop Stream] [⚙ Settings]
```

### **👥 Viewer (Port 8081):**
```
Header: "Sutantra VIEWER"  
Controls: [🔄 Refresh Streams] [▶ Join Stream] [⏹ Leave Stream]
Plus: Available Streams section
```

## 🚀 **Ready to Test:**

**The UI differentiation should now work correctly!**

1. **Refresh both browser tabs**
2. **Port 8080** → Streamer interface
3. **Port 8081** → Viewer interface with different controls

**🏆 The CSS class mismatch has been resolved! 🏆**
