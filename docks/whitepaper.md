# Sutantra: A Decentralized Live Streaming Platform
## Blockchain-Powered P2P Content Distribution with Hybrid Node Architecture


---

## Abstract

Sutantra introduces a revolutionary approach to live streaming by combining blockchain-based access control with peer-to-peer (P2P) content distribution. Our platform enables direct creator-to-viewer streaming while maintaining privacy, reducing costs, and eliminating centralized gatekeepers. Through a hybrid node architecture and innovative tokenomics, we create a sustainable ecosystem where creators control their content and viewers enjoy unrestricted access.
